Hello There! I am Hitesh, currently a first year graduate student studying MS in Robotics Engineering at the [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). 

Robots are interesting, aren't they? I’m truly fascinated by how even the simplest tasks of perception and control in robots stem from incredible engineering innovations and they are only getting better! I’m eager to delve deeper into these captivating fields for multiple real-world applications. 
My research interests lie in the intersection of Robot Control, Artificial Intelligence and Robot Perception and their applications in Robot Locomotion and other systems such as Robot Manipulators and Humanoids. One cool application of Robot Control is Trajectory Optimisation and my work as a Research Intern on this topic can be found here.

I received my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani - Hyderabad (BITS Hyderabad), India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) in July 2024. 

These are a few [Projects](https://hitesh-vs.github.io/portfolio/) in different fields of robotics that I have worked on. 

Apart from robots, I'm also a fan of Cricket, Football, Minecraft and Star Wars!
