I am currently a first year graduate student studying MS in Robotics Engineering at the [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). My research interests lie in the intersection of Robot Control and Reinforcement Learning and their applications in Robot Locomotion and other systems such as Robot Manipulators and Humanoids. Prior to this, I also worked as a Research Assistant at the [Robotics Research Centre](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/) at the [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT Hyderabad)](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), under the guidance of [Dr. Nagamanikandan Govindan](https://nagamanigi.wixsite.com/home). I received my Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani - Hyderabad (BITS Hyderabad)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) in 2024. 

These are a few [Projects](https://hitesh-vs.github.io/portfolio/) in different fields of robotics that I have worked on.
