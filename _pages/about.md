Hello There! I am Hitesh, currently a first year graduate student studying **MS in Robotics Engineering** at the [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/). 

ðŸ¤–Robots are interesting, aren't they? Iâ€™m truly fascinated by how even the simplest tasks of perception and control in robots stem from incredible engineering innovations and they are only getting better! Iâ€™m eager to delve deeper into these captivating fields for multiple real-world applications. 

Specifically, my research interests lie in the intersection of **Robot Control**, **Artificial Intelligence** and **Robot Perception** and their applications in Robot Locomotion and other systems such as Robot Manipulators and Humanoids. One cool application of Robot Control is **Trajectory Optimisation** and my work as a Research Intern on this topic can be found [here](https://hitesh-vs.github.io/research/).

These are a few other [Projects](https://hitesh-vs.github.io/portfolio/) from different fields of robotics that I have worked on.

I received my **Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering** from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani - Hyderabad (BITS Hyderabad), India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/) in July 2024.  

Apart from robots, I'm also a fan of Cricket, Football, Minecraft and Star Wars!

You can connect with me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-hitesh-viswasam-06b736204/) or through my [email](sviswasam@wpi.edu).
