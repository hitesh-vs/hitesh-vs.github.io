This project presents a framework for mobile manipulators using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) and Reward Shaping to tackle complex tasks efficiently. Intrinsic Curiosity fosters self-driven exploration, while Unity ML Agents enable a proof-of-concept for navigation and object manipulation in unknown environments. Future work aims to integrate large language models (LLMs) for task decomposition and enhanced automation.

The specific problem we aim to solve through this project is for a **mobile manipulator to learn to solve the problem of cleaning a table in a room autonomously**. For this purpose, the robot first needs to navigate to the location of the table in the room, then pick up the trash on the table and then navigate to the location of the trash can. We carried out the implementation in three phases:

1. Starting from the low level tasks, we created an RL agent to learn to navigate to a target location avoiding obstacles
2. After Reaching the location, another agent is created to learn to pick the trash
3. Once the agents for navigation and picking have learnt the optimal policies, they are integrated through the concepts of Heirarchical RL.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

The complete implementation of the above phases and the results we obtained are depicted in this presentation : [Link](https://rltaskplanner.my.canva.site/plan)

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
